# knn-regression.

The K-nearest neighbor algorithm creates an imaginary boundary to classify the data. When new data points are added for prediction, the algorithm adds that point to the nearest of the boundary line. It follows the principle of “Birds of a feather flock together.” This algorithm can easily be implemented in the python.
